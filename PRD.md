# crashpad-rs â€“ Product Requirements Document

**Status**: Draft  
**Owner**: bahamoth  
**Created**: 2025-08-05  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-05

## Executive Summary

crashpad-rs is a safe Rust wrapper for Google's Crashpad crash reporting library. It provides Rust developers with an idiomatic, zero-cost abstraction over Crashpad's C++ API, enabling robust crash reporting across multiple platforms including iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows, and Android.

## Problem Statement

Rust applications need reliable crash reporting to diagnose issues in production environments. While Google's Crashpad is a mature, battle-tested solution, its C++ API and complex Chromium build system create significant barriers for Rust developers:

1. **Complex Build System**: Crashpad requires GN and Ninja build tools - unfamiliar to most Rust developers
2. **Platform Differences**: iOS requires in-process handling while other platforms use separate processes
3. **FFI Complexity**: Direct C++ interop requires unsafe code and careful lifetime management
4. **Distribution Challenges**: Bundling and deploying the crashpad_handler executable is error-prone

## Goals & Success Indicators

### G-001: Simplify Crash Reporting Integration

Rust developers should be able to add crash reporting with minimal code and configuration.

- **Success Metric**: Basic crash reporting setup in under 5 lines of code
- **Success Metric**: Zero manual build steps required
- **Success Metric**: 90% of users successfully integrate on first attempt

### G-002: Provide Cross-Platform Consistency

A single API should work consistently across all supported platforms.

- **Success Metric**: Same user code compiles and runs on all platforms
- **Success Metric**: Platform differences handled transparently
- **Success Metric**: No platform-specific code required for basic usage

### G-003: Ensure Production Readiness

The library should be reliable enough for production deployments.

- **Success Metric**: Zero crashes caused by the crash reporter itself
- **Success Metric**: Graceful degradation when handler is missing
- **Success Metric**: Clear documentation for deployment scenarios

### G-004: Maintain Rust Ecosystem Compatibility

The library should integrate naturally with Rust tooling and conventions.

- **Success Metric**: Standard `cargo build` workflow
- **Success Metric**: Full documentation on docs.rs
- **Success Metric**: Compatible with cross-compilation

## ID Scheme & Traceability

### ID Pattern Reference
- **Requirement**: `R-###` - All requirements (functional and non-functional)
- **Goal**: `G-###` - High-level outcomes and objectives
- **Task**: `T-###` - Implementation tasks (defined in TASKS.md)
- **Decision**: `D-YYYY-MM-DD-##` - Design decisions (defined in DECISIONS.md)
- **Question**: `Q-###` - Open questions that may become requirements or tasks

### Traceability Matrix
Each requirement links to goals, and implementation tasks reference requirements. This enables full traceability from high-level goals to specific code changes.

## Target Users

### Primary Users

1. **Rust Application Developers**
   - Need: Simple crash reporting integration
   - Context: Building production applications in Rust
   - Pain Points: Complex C++ build systems, unsafe FFI code

2. **Mobile Developers (iOS/Android)**
   - Need: Platform-specific crash handling
   - Context: Building mobile apps with Rust components
   - Pain Points: iOS in-process constraints, Android NDK complexity

### Secondary Users

1. **Library Maintainers**
   - Need: Stable API for crash reporting
   - Context: Including crash reporting in their libraries
   - Pain Points: Version compatibility, optional dependencies

## Use Cases

### UC-001: Basic Desktop Application Integration
A developer building a desktop application wants to add crash reporting:
1. Add crashpad-rs to Cargo.toml
2. Initialize client with default configuration
3. Deploy application with bundled handler
4. Receive crash reports at configured endpoint

### UC-002: iOS Application Integration
An iOS developer needs crash reporting for a Rust component:
1. Add crashpad-rs with iOS target
2. Initialize in-process handler
3. No separate handler deployment needed
4. Crashes captured and sent on next app launch

### UC-003: Server Application Monitoring
A backend engineer needs crash reporting for a server application:
1. Configure crash database location
2. Set up periodic upload to crash server
3. Add custom annotations (version, environment)
4. Monitor crashes across deployment fleet

## Functional Requirements

### R-001: Crash Handler Initialization

**As a** developer  
**I need** to initialize the crash handler with minimal configuration  
**So that** my application can capture crashes immediately  
**Links**: G-001, G-002  
**Notes**: Should work with zero configuration using defaults

### R-002: Cross-Platform Handler Management

**As a** developer  
**I need** the library to handle platform differences automatically  
**So that** I don't need platform-specific code  
**Links**: G-002  
**Notes**: iOS in-process vs others out-of-process

### R-003: Handler Path Discovery

**As a** developer  
**I need** a simple way to find handler executable  
**So that** deployment is simplified  
**Links**: G-001, G-003  
**Notes**: Check alongside executable, system paths, environment variable

### R-004: Custom Annotations

**As a** developer  
**I need** to attach custom metadata to crash reports  
**So that** I can identify crash context  
**Links**: G-003  
**Notes**: Version, user ID, feature flags, etc.

### R-005: Graceful Failure Handling [Reliability]

**As a** developer  
**I need** the crash reporter to fail gracefully  
**So that** missing components don't crash my application  
**Links**: G-003  
**Performance**: Initialization must not block > 100ms

### R-006: Build System Integration [Usability]

**As a** developer  
**I need** the library to build with standard cargo commands  
**So that** I don't need to learn new build tools  
**Links**: G-004  
**Notes**: Hide GN and Ninja build complexity

### R-007: Handler Distribution

**As a** developer  
**I need** easy handler executable distribution  
**So that** deployment is straightforward  
**Links**: G-003  
**Notes**: Support for cargo xtask dist command

**Links**: G-002  
**Notes**: Two-phase: capture at crash, process on next launch

### R-009: Configuration Flexibility

**As a** developer  
**I need** to configure database path, upload URL, and behavior  
**So that** I can adapt to my infrastructure  
**Links**: G-001

2. Achieves feature parity with Crashpad's core functionality
3. Maintains < 5 open bugs at any time
4. Deployment guide covers 90% of use cases
5. Cross-platform tests pass on all supported targets

## Constraints and Dependencies

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain ABI compatibility with Crashpad
- Cannot modify Crashpad source (use as-is)
- Must support Rust 1.70+ (current MSRV)

### External Dependencies
- Google Crashpad (managed via build.rs)
- bindgen for FFI generation
- Platform SDKs (Xcode, Android NDK, etc.)

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks
1. **Crashpad API Changes**: Mitigated by minimal wrapper surface
2. **Platform Restrictions**: iOS limitations drive architecture
3. **Build Complexity**: Hidden behind build.rs automation

### Adoption Risks
1. **Learning Curve**: Mitigated by examples and documentation
2. **Trust in Safety**: Extensive testing and gradual rollout
3. **Competition**: Differentiate through Rust-native experience
