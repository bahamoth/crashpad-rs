# Tasks for the Architect

As the project architect, my focus is on ensuring the long-term health, scalability, and maintainability of the `crashpad-rs` codebase. Here are the initial tasks I will be focusing on:

1.  **Architecture Review and Documentation:**
    -   Thoroughly analyze the existing architecture of `crashpad-rs`, including `crashpad` and `crashpad-sys` crates.
    -   Update and expand the `ARCHITECTURE.md` file to reflect the current state and future vision.
    -   Create diagrams to visualize component interactions and data flow.

2.  **Dependency Management:**
    -   Review all dependencies in `Cargo.toml` for `crashpad`, `crashpad-sys`, and `xtask`.
    -   Identify any outdated, insecure, or unnecessary dependencies.
    -   Establish a policy for dependency updates and security audits (e.g., using `cargo-audit`).

3.  **API Design and Consistency:**
    -   Review the public APIs of the `crashpad` crate for clarity, consistency, and ease of use.
    -   Ensure the API follows Rust API Guidelines.
    -   Refine the error handling strategy to be more robust and user-friendly.

4.  **Build & CI/CD Process Improvement:**
    -   Analyze the `Makefile` and `xtask` implementation for potential improvements.
    -   Review the cross-compilation process documented in `CROSS_COMPILE.md` and automate where possible.
    -   Propose enhancements to the CI pipeline for faster feedback and more comprehensive testing.

5.  **Code Quality and Modularity:**
    -   Identify areas in the code that violate core principles (SRP, DRY).
    -   Propose refactoring to improve modularity and separation of concerns.
    -   Ensure the codebase is easily testable and encourages writing new tests.
